title: "Reading Data"

## Loading data into Python
In order to load our inflammation data, we need to access
([import]({{ page.root }}/reference/#import) in Python terminology) a library called
[NumPy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/ "NumPy Documentation").  In general you should use this
library if you want to do fancy things with numbers, especially if you have matrices or arrays.  We
can import NumPy using:

~~~
import numpy
~~~
{: .language-python}

Importing a library is like getting a piece of lab equipment out of a storage locker and setting it
up on the bench. Libraries provide additional functionality to the basic Python package, much like
a new piece of equipment adds functionality to a lab space. Just like in the lab, importing too
many libraries can sometimes complicate and slow down your programs - so we only import what we
need for each program. Once we've imported the library, we can ask the library to read our data
file for us:

~~~
numpy.loadtxt(fname='inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
array([[ 0.,  0.,  1., ...,  3.,  0.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  1.,  2., ...,  1.,  0.,  1.],
       [ 0.,  1.,  1., ...,  2.,  1.,  1.],
       ...,
       [ 0.,  1.,  1., ...,  1.,  1.,  1.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  0., ...,  0.,  2.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  1., ...,  1.,  1.,  0.]])
~~~
{: .output}

The expression `numpy.loadtxt(...)` is a [function call]({{ page.root }}/reference/#function-call)
that asks Python to run the [function]({{ page.root }}/reference/#function) `loadtxt` which
belongs to the `numpy` library. This [dotted notation]({{ page.root }}/reference/#dotted-notation)
is used everywhere in Python: the thing that appears before the dot contains the thing that
appears after.

As an example, John Smith is the John that belongs to the Smith family.
We could use the dot notation to write his name `smith.john`,
just as `loadtxt` is a function that belongs to the `numpy` library.

`numpy.loadtxt` has two [parameters]({{ page.root }}/reference/#parameter): the name of the file
we want to read and the [delimiter]({{ page.root }}/reference/#delimiter) that separates values on
a line. These both need to be character strings (or [strings]({{ page.root }}/reference/#string)
for short), so we put them in quotes.

Since we haven't told it to do anything else with the function's output,
the notebook displays it.
In this case,
that output is the data we just loaded.
By default,
only a few rows and columns are shown
(with `...` to omit elements when displaying big arrays).
To save space,
Python displays numbers as `1.` instead of `1.0`
when there's nothing interesting after the decimal point.

Our call to `numpy.loadtxt` read our file
but didn't save the data in memory.
To do that,
we need to assign the array to a variable. Just as we can assign a single value to a variable, we
can also assign an array of values to a variable using the same syntax.  Let's re-run
`numpy.loadtxt` and save the returned data:

~~~
data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='inflammation-01.csv', delimiter=',')
~~~
{: .language-python}

This statement doesn't produce any output because we've assigned the output to the variable `data`.
If we want to check that the data have been loaded,
we can print the variable's value:

~~~
print(data)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
[[ 0.  0.  1. ...,  3.  0.  0.]
 [ 0.  1.  2. ...,  1.  0.  1.]
 [ 0.  1.  1. ...,  2.  1.  1.]
 ...,
 [ 0.  1.  1. ...,  1.  1.  1.]
 [ 0.  0.  0. ...,  0.  2.  0.]
 [ 0.  0.  1. ...,  1.  1.  0.]]
~~~
{: .output}

Now that the data are in memory,
we can manipulate them.
First,
let's ask what [type]({{ page.root }}/reference/#type) of thing `data` refers to:

~~~
print(type(data))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<class 'numpy.ndarray'>
~~~
{: .output}

The output tells us that `data` currently refers to
an N-dimensional array, the functionality for which is provided by the NumPy library.
These data correspond to arthritis patients' inflammation.
The rows are the individual patients, and the columns
are their daily inflammation measurements.

{: .callout}

With the following command, we can see the array's [shape]({{ page.root }}/reference/#shape):

~~~
print(data.shape)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
(60, 40)
~~~
{: .output}

The output tells us that the `data` array variable contains 60 rows and 40 columns. When we
created the variable `data` to store our arthritis data, we didn't just create the array; we also
created information about the array, called [members]({{ page.root }}/reference/#member) or
attributes. This extra information describes `data` in the same way an adjective describes a noun.
`data.shape` is an attribute of `data` which describes the dimensions of `data`. We use the same
dotted notation for the attributes of variables that we use for the functions in libraries because
they have the same part-and-whole relationship.

If we want to get a single number from the array, we must provide an
[index]({{ page.root }}/reference/#index) in square brackets after the variable name, just as we
do in math when referring to an element of a matrix.  Our inflammation data has two dimensions, so
we will need to use two indices to refer to one specific value:

~~~
print('first value in data:', data[0, 0])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
first value in data: 0.0
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
print('middle value in data:', data[30, 20])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
middle value in data: 13.0
~~~
{: .output}

The expression `data[30, 20]` accesses the element at row 30, column 20. While this expression may
not surprise you,
 `data[0, 0]` might.
Programming languages like Fortran, MATLAB and R start counting at 1
because that's what human beings have done for thousands of years.
Languages in the C family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0
because it represents an offset from the first value in the array (the second
value is offset by one index from the first value). This is closer to the way
that computers represent arrays (if you are interested in the historical
reasons behind counting indices from zero, you can read
[Mike Hoye's blog post](http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2013/10/22/citation-needed/)).
As a result,
if we have an MÃ—N array in Python,
its indices go from 0 to M-1 on the first axis
and 0 to N-1 on the second.
It takes a bit of getting used to,
but one way to remember the rule is that
the index is how many steps we have to take from the start to get the item we want.

{: .callout}

## Slicing data
An index like `[30, 20]` selects a single element of an array,
but we can select whole sections as well.
For example,
we can select the first ten days (columns) of values
for the first four patients (rows) like this:

~~~
print(data[0:4, 0:10])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
[[ 0.  0.  1.  3.  1.  2.  4.  7.  8.  3.]
 [ 0.  1.  2.  1.  2.  1.  3.  2.  2.  6.]
 [ 0.  1.  1.  3.  3.  2.  6.  2.  5.  9.]
 [ 0.  0.  2.  0.  4.  2.  2.  1.  6.  7.]]
~~~
{: .output}

The [slice]({{ page.root }}/reference/#slice) `0:4` means, "Start at index 0 and go up to, but not
including, index 4."Again, the up-to-but-not-including takes a bit of getting used to, but the
rule is that the difference between the upper and lower bounds is the number of values in the slice.

We don't have to start slices at 0:

~~~
print(data[5:10, 0:10])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
[[ 0.  0.  1.  2.  2.  4.  2.  1.  6.  4.]
 [ 0.  0.  2.  2.  4.  2.  2.  5.  5.  8.]
 [ 0.  0.  1.  2.  3.  1.  2.  3.  5.  3.]
 [ 0.  0.  0.  3.  1.  5.  6.  5.  5.  8.]
 [ 0.  1.  1.  2.  1.  3.  5.  3.  5.  8.]]
~~~
{: .output}

We also don't have to include the upper and lower bound on the slice.  If we don't include the lower
bound, Python uses 0 by default; if we don't include the upper, the slice runs to the end of the
axis, and if we don't include either (i.e., if we just use ':' on its own), the slice includes
everything:

~~~
small = data[:3, 36:]
print('small is:')
print(small)
~~~
{: .language-python}
The above example selects rows 0 through 2 and columns 36 through to the end of the array.

~~~
small is:
[[ 2.  3.  0.  0.]
 [ 1.  1.  0.  1.]
 [ 2.  2.  1.  1.]]
~~~
{: .output}

Arrays also know how to perform common mathematical operations on their values.  The simplest
operations with data are arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  When you
do such operations on arrays, the operation is done element-by-element.  Thus:

~~~
doubledata = data * 2.0
~~~
{: .language-python}

will create a new array `doubledata`
each element of which is twice the value of the corresponding element in `data`:

~~~
print('original:')
print(data[:3, 36:])
print('doubledata:')
print(doubledata[:3, 36:])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
original:
[[ 2.  3.  0.  0.]
 [ 1.  1.  0.  1.]
 [ 2.  2.  1.  1.]]
doubledata:
[[ 4.  6.  0.  0.]
 [ 2.  2.  0.  2.]
 [ 4.  4.  2.  2.]]
~~~
{: .output}

If, instead of taking an array and doing arithmetic with a single value (as above), you did the
arithmetic operation with another array of the same shape, the operation will be done on
corresponding elements of the two arrays.  Thus:

~~~
tripledata = doubledata + data
~~~
{: .language-python}

will give you an array where `tripledata[0,0]` will equal `doubledata[0,0]` plus `data[0,0]`,
and so on for all other elements of the arrays.

~~~
print('tripledata:')
print(tripledata[:3, 36:])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
tripledata:
[[ 6.  9.  0.  0.]
 [ 3.  3.  0.  3.]
 [ 6.  6.  3.  3.]]
~~~
{: .output}

Often, we want to do more than add, subtract, multiply, and divide array elements.  NumPy knows how
to do more complex operations, too.  If we want to find the average inflammation for all patients on
all days, for example, we can ask NumPy to compute `data`'s mean value:

~~~
print(numpy.mean(data))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
6.14875
~~~
{: .output}

`mean` is a [function]({{ page.root }}/reference/#function) that takes
an array as an [argument]({{ page.root }}/reference/#argument).

This episode demonstrates all the features that can be used when writing a
lesson in [RMarkdown][r-markdown].

To generate the site, you will need to have the following packages installed:


```r
install.packages(c("knitr", "stringr", "checkpoint"))
```

If the lesson uses additional packages, the script that converts the Rmd files
into markdown, will detect them and install them for you, when you run `make
serve` or `make site`.

This first chunk is really important, and need to be included at the beginning of
each episode written in RMarkdown.


~~~
source("../bin/chunk-options.R")
~~~
{: .language-r}

The rest of the lesson should be written as a normal RMarkdown file. You can
include chunk for codes, just like you'd normally do.

Normal output:


~~~
1 + 1
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] 2
~~~
{: .output}

Output with error message:


~~~
x[10]
~~~
{: .language-r}



~~~
[1] NA
~~~
{: .output}

Output generating figures:


~~~
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = carat,  y = price, color = cut)) +
    geom_point()
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-plot-example-1.png" title="plot of chunk plot-example" alt="plot of chunk plot-example" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

For the challenges and their solutions, you need to pay attention to where the
`>` go and where to leave blank lines. You can include code chunks in both the
instructions and solutions. For instance this:

```
> ## Challenge: Can you do it?
>
> What is the output of this command?
>
>
> ~~~
> paste("This", "new", "template", "looks", "good")
> ~~~
> {: .language-r}
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> >
> > ~~~
> > [1] "This new template looks good"
> > ~~~
> > {: .output}
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}
```

will generate this:

> ## Challenge: Can you do it?
>
> What is the output of this command?
>
>
> ~~~
> paste("This", "new", "template", "looks", "good")
> ~~~
> {: .language-r}
